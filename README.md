# Startpage

A simple startpage for your web browser, with a todo list to track your todos.

- Terminal-like minimal tree style quick links and bookmarks startpage
- Todo list with creation, deletion, and editing
- Uses local storage to store todos, so doesn't require a database.

Although clearing site cache will delete all your todos, so make sure not to clear cache.

Uses React and tailwind for frontend, written in typescript.

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5137`.
